The core place where we differ from Kult is in our Cosmology. The World of our City is one where humanity did have access to divinity, lived in close harmony with it and fell, tumbling into a prison of the flesh, devils and worse. You may find some of the forces that hold humanity imprisoned changes, as well as a greatly expanded list of realms to travel to. 

In short, we will be using the mechanics of Kult to tell a tale of personal, cosmic and spiritual horror where freedom and power comes at the price of one's soul, immense sin and tremendous savagery, but the world, entities and horrors within it will be of our own making. 

As opposed to the Kults normal time period, being set in a vaguely modern time, we instead play in a vaguely historical setting of the period between the world wars, sometime during prohibition.
